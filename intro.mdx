Given the next Mario object:

```javascript
const player = {
	name: "Mario",
	level: 21,
	lifes: 3,
	size: "small",
	world: "Bowser's Fury"
}
```

Use call or apply to execute the next actions to the player:

`fireFlower()` shows in the console `Fire {name}` .

`superMushroom()` shows in the console `{name} went from small to super size` and change the player size to `super` .

`die(reason)` shows in the console `{name} died because of {reason}` and decrement by 1 the amount of the player lifes.
